## How to register an extension

Once your extension meets the above-mentioned criteria you can add it by submitting a pull request to this repository.

Projects are located in the [manifest.json](https://github.com/Kentico/devnet.kentico.com/blob/master/marketplace/manifest.json) file. To add your project create a new entry in the JSON object. [This guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-another-users-repository) shows you how to propose new changes directly in your browser without having to clone the repository to your machine.

### Example configuration

The `.json` file entry contains details about your projects:

```json
[
   {
    "name": "YouTube Video widget",
    "description": "Widget allowing to select and render a YouTube video on site.",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kentico/devnet.kentico.com/master/marketplace/assets/kentico-icon.png",
    "author": "kentico",
    "sourceUrl": "https://github.com/Kentico/ems-mvc-components#warning-this-repo-is-in-development",
    "version": "1.1.42",
    "kenticoVersions": [
      "12.0.0"
      "12.0.29"
    ],
    "category": "mvc widget",
    "tags": [
       "mvc",
       "youtube",
        "video",
        "inline-editor"
      ]
  }
]
```

| Property        | Type | Description|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| name      | string | Name of the extension (max 40 characters).|
| description      | string | Description of the extension (max 160 characters).|
| thumbnailUrl<sup>1</sup>      | string | Url to the thumbnail image (must be jpg/jpeg/png with 100x100px resolution and using the HTTPS). |
| author<sup>2</sup>      | string | Name of the author and company if aplicable. (max 40 characters).|
| sourceUrl      | string | Url to the extension (must be using HTTPS).|
| version<sup>3</sup>      | string | Last version of the extension version (must follow the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org)).|
| kenticoVersions<sup>4</sup>      | array of strings | Kentico supported versions (version entries must follow the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org)).|
| category      | string | Category of the extension. (One of these string `module`, `webpart`, `website template`, `utility`, `mvc widget`, `mvc section`, `mvc form component`, `mvc inline editor`, `mvc personalization condition type`, `other`)|
| tag      | array of strings | List that tags you want to mark an extension with.|

> <sup>1</sup> You could provide the icon to the [assets](/marketplace/assets) folder as a part of the pull request and use URL format as is showcased in the [example configuration](#example-configuration) for the `thumbnailUrl` configuration property.

> <sup>2</sup> If you want to bind your activity with Kentico Partner Program, provide the company name.

> <sup>3</sup> Recommended is to start version numbering from `1.0.0`, but there are no limitations until the versioning following the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). Specified version is supposed to be bound to the last entry of the `kenticoVersions` array.

> <sup>4</sup> A version of the Kentico EMS that the extension is referencing. The array is for keeping the record of what Kentico version was supported in past extension releases. The last one is assumed to be bound to the `version` record. A recommended approach is to have a table mapping the extension version to Kentico EMS version in the description linked in `sourceUrl` attribute.

## Updating an extension

If you release a new version of the extension, update the record entry in the `JSON` file and reference the older version from the description linked by the `sourceUrl` link. We recommend to increment the major version in `version` when the major version of `kenticoVersion` is incremented. When the extension is stored in GIT repository, it is possible to use [tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) or [branches](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) to separate version source code.
